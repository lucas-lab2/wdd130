#A CSS rule's selector is the first part of the rule that tells the browser which HTML elements should have the CSS property values applied. 
The elements selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.

CSS Selector Types:

Selector Type	Example	CSS Rule Application
Universal	* { ... }	Applies to all elements
Type	h1 { ... }	Applies to all <h1> elements
Class	.red { ... }	Applies to all elements with the "red" class value
ID	#red { ... }	Applies to the one element with the "red" id value


#A class attribute can be applied to many elements on a document.
More than one class can be applied to a single element. 
The class can be selected by using period (.) notation.

#A id attribute can only be applied to one element per document and each element may only have one id. 
The id can be selected by CSS id selector using hash (#) notation.

#It is recommended that you start with the following CSS declaration for all of your work in this class to help control the aspect ratio of images.

  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
